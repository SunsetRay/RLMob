# RLMob
Code for the paper "RLMob: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Successive Mobility Prediction" 

- run run.py to launch the framework (recommend to use "nohup python -u run.py >log/F_ppo.log 2>&1 &" to see the log)
- run pretrain/main.py to pretrain (parameters are at the top of train.py)
- data TBD
